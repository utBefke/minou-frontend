We’re building a premium dating experience designed around intention, not volume.
Instead of endless swiping, users receive a small number of curated introduction videos.
To participate, you must first introduce yourself on video — mutual presence is required.

There are no likes, no instant matches, and no infinite feeds.
To express interest, users write a short, intentional message — a modern letter of intent — before any connection is made.

The interface is slow, weighted, and deliberate, treating time as the most valuable currency.
This is not a dating app for attention.
It’s a guided experience for people who want to meet consciously.


--------------------------------------------------------------

The goal is to create a luxuries and premium feeling dating app. 
Time is our most valuable currency. Therfore i want this app to stand out and break the normal dating apps. 
Not like after like, not profile after profile. A few profiles that match with yours, an introduction-video (15-20s). 
A from right to left to open the sidepanel (intentional) to view more about this person. 
You must 'sign in a textbox like space' with a golden pen that you want to learn to know this person based on the introduction video. 
Only a few things revealing. Not spamming people with ads, likes, profiles that are fake. 
Also you need to post a video about yourself before you can see the introduction-videos 'feed'. A few wel crafted matches and a guided expierence.
